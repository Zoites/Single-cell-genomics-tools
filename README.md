# Single Cell Genomics Tools
Tools used to analyse single-cell genomic data

## Quality Control
[PaSD-qc](https://github.com/parklab/PaSDqc)
Evaluates the amplification properties and quality of single cell whole-genome sequencing data. [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186545)

## Variant Calling
[Monovar](https://bitbucket.org/hamimzafar/monovar) is a single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection and genotyping algorithm for single-cell DNA sequencing data. [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27088313)

[SCcaller](https://github.com/biosinodx/SCcaller/) identifies single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (INDELs) from single cell sequencing data. [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28319112)


## Copy Number Variation
[Ginkgo](https://github.com/robertaboukhalil/ginkgo) is a cloud-based single-cell copy-number variation analysis tool. [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4775251/)


## Clonal Evolution
#### E-scape: 
  [MapScape](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/mapscape/inst/doc/mapscape_vignette.html) is a visualization tool for spatial clonal evolution.
  
  [TimeScape](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/timescape/inst/doc/timescape_vignette.html) is a visualization tool for temporal clonal evolution.

## Phylogeny
#### E-scape:
  [CellScape](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/cellscape/inst/doc/cellscape_vignette.html) is a visualization tool for integrating single cell phylogeny with genomic content to clearly display evolutionary progression and tumour heterogeneity.

  [SiFit](https://bitbucket.org/hamimzafar/sifit) is a tool for reconstructing phylogenetic tree from noisy mutation profile of single cells. [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28927434)
